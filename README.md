**Problem Statement: Student Wellness & Performance Monitoring Dashboard**

Colleges and schools collect data on students’ academic performance, attendance, and extracurricular 
activities, but they rarely combine it with wellness indicators like sleep, stress levels, and exercise. 
Without this, it is difficult to identify students at risk of burnout or poor performance. 

**Objective:**
Your task is to design an Excel Dashboard that integrates both academic and wellness data 
to help faculty or counselors identify patterns and support student well-being. 

**Dataset Description:**
- Attendance_% : Percentage of classes attended by student
- Avg_Study_Hours : Average study hours per day
- Sleep_Hours : Average sleep hours per night
- Stress_Level(1-10) : Self-reported stress score (1 = low, 10 = high)
- Exercise_Days : Number of days student exercises per week
- Midterm_Score : Score obtained in midterm exam
- Final_Score : Score obtained in final exam
- Extracurricular_Hours : Weekly time spent in extracurricular activities

**Expected Dashboard Features:**
1. Student Wellness Overview – averages of sleep, stress, and exercise.
2. Academic vs Wellness Correlation – scatter plots (e.g., Sleep vs Scores, Stress vs Performance).
3. At-Risk Student Identification – highlight those with Attendance < 75%, Stress > 7, Final Score < 60.
4. Group Comparisons – compare students active in extracurriculars vs those who aren’t.
5. Interactive Filters – slicers by stress category, attendance range, or study hours.

**Deliverable:**
An interactive Excel dashboard that helps visualize how student wellness affects academic 
performance and provides insights to take preventive actions.
